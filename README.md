# dogdetect-cnn
My first attempt at building a CNN with the goal of detecting dogs in 32x32 images.

Project powered by TensorFlow 2.9.1

Run the notebook file dogdetector.ipynb in the src directory to build and train the model.

To avoid having to download all the correct dependencies simply run the shell script, it will run a docker image with Jupyter which you will be able to open in your browser with the link provided in the docker output.

The dataset used is CINIC-10: https://github.com/BayesWatch/cinic-10
